## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Our project focuses on taking the chore out of the painstaking process of nurse rostering with the objective of reducing the time taken to achieve the best possible schedule in a highly repeatable manner, in a localized context. As discussed in the final report (found on the main project repository, described in Section 3), some future enhancements can be considered such as better User Interface and multi-tenancy support.

Hence this project companion aims to showcase the potential implementation of these two features, based on the great Open Source work contributed by the KIE Group for Optaplanner (Please see section 6 for references).

For additional context on the localized business problem and challenges, please refer to the final report on the main project repository.
